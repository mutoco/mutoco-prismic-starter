# Prismic Starter

Starter for a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) & [Prismic](https://prismic.io) Website.

## Creating a project

Create a new project by using the `Use this template` feature in Github.

## Set the .env file

Create a `.env` file. Just copying/renaming the `.env.example` file should be enough.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
