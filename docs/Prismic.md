# About Prismic

Prismic is a cloud-hosted headless CMS. In the CMS you define your content-types and the content.

Each project should use a separate "Repository". To have a working backend, we created a Repository named: https://mutoco-starter.prismic.io/

## Setting up

For a new project, you should create a new repository in the [Prismic dashboard](https://prismic.io/dashboard). 
Make sure to choose a fitting repository name. For `mutoco-starter.prismic.io`, the repository name is `mutoco-starter`.

## Modelling content-types

This depends entirely on the requirements of the project. Here's the official documentation regarding content-modelling
in Prismic: https://prismic.io/docs/core-concepts#content-modeling
